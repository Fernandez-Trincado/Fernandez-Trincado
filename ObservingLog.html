  The origin of the globular cluster \omega Cen and its role in the assembly of
  the galactic halo is still not well understood. It has been proposed that the cluster is indeed
  a nucleated dwarf galaxy that was tidally disrupted when it merged with the first generation of
  the Galactic thin disk. While debris from \omega Cen has been found in the solar neighborhood, the
  search for the remains of the disrupted galaxy near the cluster itself has been more elusive. Here we
  propose to measure radial velocities from SOAR/Goodman spectroscopy of 49 RR Lyrae stars that have been
  found in an area of ~ 100 sq degrees around the cluster by the QUEST and Catalina photometric surveys. Our
  targets were chosen to have a similar distance (+/- a few kpc) as the globular cluster. By combining accurate
  distances and velocities we will be able to identify any possible cold substructure in the region, if it exists.
  Even a negative results will provide strong constraints on the origin of this peculiar object.

 We propose to obtain follow-up spectra of 13 RR Lyrae stars recently
 discovered with the QUEST camera at the 1m Schmidt telescope at the Venezuelan National Observatory. These
 stars lie within ∼ 10 ◦ from the center of the globular cluster ωCen, and they have the same magnitude as its
 horizontal branch. Thus, they are strong candidates to be material stripped from the cluster or from the disrupted
 galaxy associated with it. Radial velocities will allow us to conﬁrm a physical association with the cluster and
 can provide constrains in the models of the destruction of ωCen by the tidal forces of the Milky Way.
